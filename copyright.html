        <p><h1>History of Copyright</h1>
	<br>“Congress shall have the Power . . . To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”
	– United States Constitution, Art. I, Section 8<br>
      In 1790, the Constitution decided to allow authors to gain reward for their work.
On May 31, 1790, the first copyright law is enacted under the new United States Constitution. Modeled off Britain’s Statute of Anne, the new law is relatively limited in scope, protecting books, maps, and charts for only fourteen years with a renewal period of another fourteen years. There was no Library of Congress or Copyright Office at the time, so works had to be registered in the U.S. District Court where the author or proprietor lived.


Congress amended the Copyright Act of 1790 many times over the next century. These amendments greatly changed what works were covered under copyright, for how long, and how to register a work. Important changes included:
<ol>
<li>Extending the initial period of protection from fourteen years to twenty-eight years (1831);</li>
<li>expanding copyrightable works; through amendment, Congress added the following categories to protectable works:
“historical and other prints” (1802),
dramatic works (1856),
photographs (1865), and
visual art (1870);</li>
<li>expanding the exclusive rights of authors to include:
the right of public performance for dramatic works (1856) and musical compositions (1897) and</li>
the right to create derivative works (1870);
changing the process for gaining copyright protection by
requiring copyright owners include a prescribed notice on every copy distributed to the public (1802)
	  
	   The first major Supreme Court case of Copyright was in 1830	but was not given a verdivt until 40 years after the 1790 act.
	  




		<h3>Copyright</h3>is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. In copyright law, there are a lot of different types of works, including paintings, photographs, illustrations, musical compositions, sound recordings, computer programs, books, poems, blog posts, movies, architectural works, plays, and so much more!
           When someone creates a product that is viewed as original and that required significant mental activity to create, this product becomes an intellectual property that must be protected from unauthorized duplication. Examples of unique creations include:
<ol>
<li>Novels</li>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
<li>Musical lyrics and compositions</li>
<li>Computer software</li>
<li>Graphic designs</li>
<li>Film</li>
<li>Original architectural designs</li>
<li>Website content</li>
</ol>
<h2>What rights does copyright provide</h2>
U.S. copyright law provides copyright owners with the following exclusive rights:<
<ul>

<li>Reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords.</li>
<li>repare derivative works based upon the work.</li>
<li>Distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending.</li>
<li>Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.</li>
<li>Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a pantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.</li>
<li>Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is a sound recording.</li>
</ul>
