	 The transition of copyrighted works into the public domain involves a series of events and considerations,
	 primarily influenced by the duration of copyright protection and certain legal provisions. Below is the process by which a work of art transtions from the cooyright right to Public Domain.
	 <ol>
	 <li><br>Creation and Originality</br></li>:
Copyright begins at the moment of creation when a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression. This could include writing, recording, or any form that allows the work to be perceived, reproduced, or communicated.

<li><br>Duration of Copyright<br></li>:
Copyright protection is not perpetual; it has a limited duration. The specific duration varies by jurisdiction and the type of work. In many countries, the standard duration is the life of the author plus a certain number of years (e.g., 70 years in many cases).
<li><br>Expiration of Copyright:

Once the copyright term expires, the work transitions into the public domain. At this point, the work is no longer protected by copyright, and the public gains the right to use, reproduce, distribute, and adapt the work without seeking permission from or paying royalties to the original copyright holder.
<li><br>Renewal and Extension Provisions<br></li>:

Some jurisdictions have provisions for the renewal or extension of copyright terms, often involving additional requirements or fees. However, many works do not undergo renewal, allowing them to naturally enter the public domain after the initial copyright term.
<li><br>Abandonment and Dedication<br></li>:

In certain cases, copyright holders may choose to abandon their rights or dedicate the work to the public domain voluntarily. This can be achieved through statements of dedication or the use of licenses that relinquish certain rights.
<li><br>Government Works<br></li>:

Works created by government entities are often automatically in the public domain. Government publications, reports, and other materials are typically free from copyright restrictions, allowing for broad use and dissemination.
<li><br>Failure to Comply with Formalities<br></li>:

In the past, copyright laws required authors to comply with formalities such as registration and renewal. Failure to adhere to these formalities could result in the forfeiture of copyright protection. Many modern copyright laws, however, have eliminated such requirements.
<li><br>Expiration of Patents<br></li>:

In the case of patented inventions, the expiration of the patent term results in the disclosure of the invention to the public. While not the same as copyright, this transition allows others to freely use, make, and sell the patented invention.
<li><br>Public Domain Day<br></li>:

Some jurisdictions celebrate Public Domain Day, an annual event that marks the entry of works into the public domain as their copyright terms expire. This often occurs on January 1st each year.
<li><br>International Considerations<br></li>:

Copyright laws vary internationally, and the duration of copyright protection can differ between countries. Works may enter the public domain at different times in different jurisdictions.
